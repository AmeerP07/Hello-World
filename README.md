Hello Humans

First time user trying to educate myself on some backend coding. Currently working in the banking/financial sector as someone who educates staff and clients on digital banking use online web and mobile app platforms. This has harnessed a huge interest in learning how these platforms perform and possibly enter into working on them in the backend.
